## 1. How Did You Run the Code?
To run a Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

## Setup the Project:
Ensure you have the project set up correctly with all necessary dependencies defined in your pom.xml (for Maven)

Database Configuration:
Set up your database (e.g., MySQL) and configure the connection properties in src/main/resources/application.properties. Example properties: properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name spring.datasource.username=your_username spring.datasource.password=your_password spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

## Run the Application:
Using IDE: Right-click on the main application class (annotated with @SpringBootApplication) and select "Run" or "Debug". Using Command Line: Navigate to the project directory.

Verify:

Open a web browser or Postman and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to check if the application is running.

## 2. How Did You Run the Machine Test?
To run tests on your Spring Boot application, you generally follow these steps:

Write Tests:

Create unit tests using JUnit and integration tests using Spring's testing framework. Tests are typically placed in the src/test/java directory. Example Test:

A simple test for your ProductService might look like this:
java @SpringBootTest public class ProductServiceTest { @Autowired private ProductService productService;

@Test
public void testGetProductById() {
    Product product = productService.getProductById(1L).orElse(null);
    assertNotNull(product);
}
}

## 3. Database Design
When discussing your database design, focus on the following aspects:

Entities:
Identify the main entities in your application. you might have: Category: Fields: id, name

Product: Fields: id, name, description, price, category_id

Relationships:

### One-to-Many: A category can have multiple products, but a product belongs to one category. This can be represented in your database with a foreign key in the Product table referencing the Category table. Database Tables:

Category Table:

Column Name Data Type id BIGINT name VARCHAR(255)

Product Table:

Column Name Data Type id BIGINT name VARCHAR(255) description TEXT price DECIMAL(10, 2) category_id BIGINT
